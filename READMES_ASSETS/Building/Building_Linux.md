# Linux Build Steps:

Dolphin requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for systems other than Windows. 
You need a recent version of GCC or Clang with decent c++20 support. CMake will
inform you if your compiler is too old.
Many libraries are bundled with Dolphin and used if they're not installed on 
your system. CMake will inform you if a bundled library is used or if you need
to install any missing packages yourself. You may refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/wiki/Building-for-Linux) for more information.

Make sure to pull submodules before building:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Linux Global Build Steps:

To install to your system.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make -j $(nproc)`
5. `sudo make install`

### Linux Local Build Steps:

Useful for development as root access is not required.

1. `mkdir Build`
2. `cd Build`
3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`
4. `make -j $(nproc)`
5. `ln -s ../../Data/Sys Binaries/`

### Linux Portable Build Steps:

Can be stored on external storage and used on different Linux systems.
Or useful for having multiple distinct Dolphin setups for testing/development/TAS.

1. `mkdir Build`
2. `cd Build`
3. `cmake .. -DLINUX_LOCAL_DEV=true`
4. `make -j $(nproc)`
5. `cp -r ../Data/Sys/ Binaries/`
6. `touch Binaries/portable.txt`

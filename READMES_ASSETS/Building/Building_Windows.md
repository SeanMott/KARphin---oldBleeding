# Building for Windows

Use the solution file `Source/dolphin-emu.sln` to build Dolphin on Windows.
Dolphin targets the latest MSVC shipped with Visual Studio or Build Tools.
Other compilers might be able to build Dolphin on Windows but have not been
tested and are not recommended to be used. Git and latest Windows SDK must be
installed when building.

Make sure to pull submodules before building:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The "Release" solution configuration includes performance optimizations for the best user experience but complicates debugging Dolphin.
The "Debug" solution configuration is significantly slower, more verbose and less permissive but makes debugging Dolphin easier.

## Uninstalling

On Windows, simply remove the extracted directory, unless it was installed with the NSIS installer,
in which case you can uninstall Dolphin like any other Windows application.

Linux users can run `cat install_manifest.txt | xargs -d '\n' rm` as root from the build directory
to uninstall Dolphin from their system.

macOS users can simply delete Dolphin.app to uninstall it.

Additionally, you'll want to remove the global user directory if you don't plan on reinstalling Dolphin.
